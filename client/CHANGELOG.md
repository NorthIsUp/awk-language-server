- Bug fix: crash in `split()` on entry without doc comment

- Not explicitly declared names are marked as global variables without the
  ability to jump to their declaration
    
- All symbols available for completion and hover
    
- Added some more pre-defined functions; print and exit are now also
  declared as functions.
